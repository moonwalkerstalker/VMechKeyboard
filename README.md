We are working on a first release with basic functionality with key up and key down sounds, with app running on background

# VMechKeyboard - Mechanical Keyboard Simulator

VMechKeyboard is a Windows WPF application built using C# and .NET 7 that simulates the experience of using a mechanical keyboard, complete with customizable audio feedback for key presses and releases. If you love mechanical keyboards but want to replicate that satisfying audio feedback on a non-mechanical keyboard, this application is for you.

## Features

- **Mechanical Keyboard Simulation:** Experience the auditory satisfaction of typing on a mechanical keyboard, even if you're using a non-mechanical keyboard.

- **Customizable Audio Feedback:** Unlike other keyboard simulators, VMechKeyboard offers both key down and key up sound effects. Customize these sounds to your liking, making your typing experience truly personal.

## Why VMechKeyboard?

This is perfect for enthusiasts who appreciate the tactile feedback that mechanical keyboards provide.
